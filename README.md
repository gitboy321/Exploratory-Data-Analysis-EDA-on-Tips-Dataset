Data Analysis using Python
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Tips Dataset

Summary

1.Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Tips dataset to study customer tipping behavior in a restaurant environment.
2.Analyzed the impact of total bill, gender, day, time, smoking status, and group size on tip amounts.
3.Used Python-based data analysis and visualization techniques to derive actionable insights.

Problem Statements

1.How does the total bill affect the tip amount?
2.Is tipping behavior different across gender?
3.Do customers tip more during Lunch or Dinner?
4.Which day of the week generates higher tips?
5.Does group size influence tipping behavior?
6.Does smoking status impact the tip amount?

Solutions

1.Analyzed the relationship between total bill and tip using scatter plots and correlation analysis.
2.Compared average tips by gender using bar plots and group-by operations.
3.Evaluated tipping patterns across time (Lunch vs Dinner) using box plots.
4.Calculated day-wise average tips to identify high-performing days.
5.Studied tip distribution across different group sizes using aggregation techniques.
6.Compared tipping behavior between smokers and non-smokers using categorical analysis.

Insights

1.Tips increase as the total bill amount increases.
2.Dinner time customers tend to give higher tips than lunch customers.
3.Weekend days receive higher customer volume and higher average tips.
4.Larger group sizes generally contribute to higher total tips.
5.Gender has minimal impact on tipping behavior.
6.Smoking status shows no significant influence on tip amounts.

Conclusion

The exploratory data analysis of the Tips dataset shows that tipping behavior is mainly influenced by the total bill amount and the time of dining. Customers generally give higher tips during dinner, especially on weekends, which is likely due to larger bills and group dining. Group size also has a noticeable effect on the total tip amount, while factors such as gender and smoking status have very little impact. Overall, this project demonstrates how EDA helps uncover meaningful patterns in customer behavior and supports data-driven decision making.
